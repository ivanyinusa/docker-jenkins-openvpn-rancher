This setup will use 4 instances to run Rancher server, Jenkins, Tomcat and an
OpenVPN server. Then you will be able to work, build, deploy over a VPN link to
instances in the cloud.

Setup our cloud
----------------

Get our credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Log on our https://portal.exoscale.ch[cloud provider] portal and get the
https://portal.exoscale.ch/account/profile/api[account API credentials] which
you need to expose as environment variables, in my case using exoscale:
[source,shell]
----
export DEMO_API_KEY='<your api key>'
export DEMO_SECRET_KEY='<your secret key>'
export CLOUDSTACK_ENDPOINT='https://api.exoscale.ch/compute'
export CLOUDSTACK_KEY=$DEMO_API_KEY
export CLOUDSTACK_SECRET=$DEMO_SECRET_KEY
----

Create a security group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a security group by using this
link:scripts/01-security-group.py[python script]:
[source,shell]
----
# Create a virtual environment named ".venv"
python3 -m venv .venv
source ./.venv/bin/activate
# Install the cs package // <1>
pip install cs
# Deploy firewall rules
./scripts/create-security-group.py "demo-devoxx"
----
<1> https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cs

Or manually create one in the interface with those rules:

- Allow 22/tcp, 2376/tcp and 8080/tcp ports from any source, needed for Docker
  machine to provision hosts.
- Allow 500/udp and 4500/udp ports from any source, needed for Rancher network.
- Allow 9345/tcp and 9346/tcp ports from any source, needed for UI features
  like graphs, view logs, and execute shell.
- Allow 1194/tcp and 2222/tcp ports from any source, needed to publish our VPN
  server container.
- Allow 443/tcp ports from any source, needed to access Rancher UI over HTTPS.

Create a docker machine
-----------------------

. Start a new docker machine directly from your local machine by using a
  docker driver since exoscale is providing one:

    docker-machine create --driver exoscale \
        --exoscale-api-key $DEMO_API_KEY \
        --exoscale-api-secret-key $DEMO_SECRET_KEY \
        --exoscale-instance-profile 'Tiny' \
        --exoscale-disk-size '50' \
        --exoscale-image 'ubuntu-16.04' \
        --exoscale-security-group 'demo-devoxx' \
        --exoscale-availability-zone 'ch-dk-2' \
        "devoxxuk-ma"

. Export the docker machine environment variables for this new machine:

    eval $(docker-machine env devoxxuk-ma)

. Start a docker container with Rancher server on our new docker machine:

    docker run -d -p 8080:8080 rancher/server:stable

. Point your browser to the public IP found in
  https://portal.exoscale.ch/compute/instances[the portal] for our instance:
`http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8080/` (http://159.100.249.155:8080/ in my case).


[NOTE]
====
*TLS*

At the time of writing, there's a bug in the rancher server UI which loads
content over http only, making impossible to start a NGINX-TLS proxy in
front of it. You'll find in `docker-compose.yml` file the setup to run rancher
behind a nginx + let's encrypt proxy.
====

Provisioning Docker hosts
-------------------------

. First you need to add our cloud provider, exoscale in my case, as it's not
enabled by default.
+
image::rancher-add-host.png[title="Only a few provider are enabled by default"]
+
. Click on _Manage available machine drivers_ and click the _play_ sign button to
the far right to enable _exoscale_ driver.
+
image::rancher-add-host-drivers.png[]
+
. Go back in your browser and you will see the logo for exoscale, click on it
and enter your credentials, the same as used before for docker.
+
image::rancher-add-host-exoscale.png[]
+
. Next choose the security group you created in the portal (_might be buggy_)
+
image::rancher-add-host-security-group.png[]
+
. Next choose the number of instances, 3 for our scenario (VPN, Jenkins,
  Tomcat). Named them as you want and choose a profile size that suits your
  needs.
+
image::rancher-add-host-instance.png[]


Now we have a working rancher server running on a cloud instance with a
provision of 3 hosts to run containers on them. Let's deploy those 3
containers:

- OpenVPN to create the VPN acess.
- Jenkins to build our webapp.
- Tomcat to run our webapp.



Setup containers on Rancher server
----------------------------------

Time to deploy a first service, click on _Add Service_ button (_you will have
to do this add 3 times_)

image::rancher-add-service.png[]



OpenVPN
~~~~~~~
For the OpenVPN container:

. Scale it to 1 container.
+
image::rancher-add-service-container.png[]
+
. Enter a name for it: *rancher-vpn-server*.
. Enter the docker image: *nixel/rancher-vpn-server:latest*.
. Add this TCP port map: 1194 (on Host) to 1194 (in Container).
. Add this TCP port map: 2222 (on Host) to 2222 (in Container).
+
image::rancher-service-openvpn.png[]
+
. In _Volume_ section add a new volume to persist the VPN configuration:
  `/etc/openvpn:/etc/openvpn`
+
image::rancher-service-openvpn-volumes.png[]
+
. In _Security_ enable the container _full access to the host_ by checking the
  box.
+
image::rancher-service-openvpn-security.png[]
. And start the container

After a while the container will be ready. But you don't need to wait before
creating the other ones.


Jenkins
~~~~~~~
. Scale it to 1 container.
+
image::rancher-add-service-container.png[]
+
. Enter a name for it: *jenkins*.
. Enter the docker image: *jenkins*.
. No port map is required
+
image::rancher-service-jenkins.png[]
+
. In _Volume_ section add a new volume to persist the Jenkins configuration:
  `/var/jenkins_home`
+
image::rancher-service-jenkins-volumes.png[]
+
. And start it!.


Tomcat
~~~~~~
. Scale it to 1 container.
+
image::rancher-add-service-container.png[]
+
. Enter a name for it: *tomcat*.
. Enter the docker image: *tutum/tomcat:7.0*.
. No port map is required
+
image::rancher-service-tomcat.png[]
+
. And start it!.


Now we have 3 services running on our rancher server:

image::rancher-service-list.png[]


Connect to the VPN
------------------

You need to access the logs of the VPN server to get the generated password
to download the configuration. Go in `Infrastructure` -> `Hosts` to see the
3 instances details. On the vpn server container, clikc the 3 vertical dots
and choose `View Logs`.

image::rancher-host-vpn-view-logs.png[]

image::openvpn-logs.png[title="Command line in the logs to download the VPN configuration."]

Using a OpenVPN client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download the configuration file for OpenVPN through SSH as you will see in the
log output with the corresponding command line. In my case I got this command:
[source,shell]
----
sshpass -p Kkd58ew5gEk0QCcZFrWq ssh -p 2222 -o ConnectTimeout=4 -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no root@185.19.30.240 "get_vpn_client_conf.sh 185.19.30.240:1194" > RancherVPNClient.ovpn
----

Best is it to do the `ssh -p 2222 ...` command and enter the password in the
prompt, skipping the use of `sshpass`.
[source,shell]
----
ssh -p 2222 -o ConnectTimeout=4 -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no root@185.19.30.240 "get_vpn_client_conf.sh 185.19.30.240:1194" > RancherVPNClient.ovpn
# when prompt enter: Kkd58ew5gEk0QCcZFrWq
----

And just load it in your OpenVPN client, and start the connection to the
server. Now you are able to connect to Jenkins and tomcat using their own
container IP address you'll find on the service view. If you tried before
connecting the VPN, you wouldn't have been able.


Configure Jenkins
-----------------

First we will need to get the admin password for Tomcat to be able to deploy
the app. On the rancher server interface, go to the host view again, and
view the Tomcat logs.

image::rancher-host-tomcat-view-logs.png[]

image::tomcat-logs.png[title="Keep this admin password for later"]

Open your browser to the http://JENKINS_CONTAINER:8080 (in my case
http://10.42.45.156:8080/)

image::jenkins-dashboard.png[title="Jenkins Dashboard"]

Before starting you must install Github Plugin and Maven following these steps:

. Click _Manage Jenkins_ menu option and then Manage Plugins
. Go to Available tab and search for Github plugin, named “Github Plugin”.
  Activate its checkbox
. Click Download now and install after restart button
. When the plugin is installed enable checkbox Restart Jenkins when
  installation is complete and no jobs are running, and then wait for Jenkins
  to be restarted
. When Jenkins is running again, go to Manage Jenkins and click Configure
  System
. In Maven section click Add Maven button, enter a name for the installation
  and choose the maven version you want, in my case the latest available 3.3.9.
+
image::jenkins-maven-config.png[]
+
. Click Save button to finish

Create a new job in the _Dashboard_, clikc _create new jobs_ and do as follow:

. Enter a job name, for example _devoxx-demo_
. Choose _Maven project_ and click _OK_
+
image::jenkins-new-job.png[]
+
. In _Source Code Management_ section choose _Git_ and enter this repository
  url:
  - https://github.com/marcaurele/sample-spring-boot
. In _Build_ section enter the following maven goals and options. Replace
  *TOMCAT_CONTAINER_IP* with the IP assigned to your Tomcat container
  (10.42.18.196 in my case) and *TOMCAT_ADMIN_PASSWORD* with the password we
  saw in the Tomcat logs of the container (`2VPRIHq3Lcq4` in my case).
+
    clean package tomcat7:redeploy -DTOMCAT_HOST=TOMCAT_CONTAINER_IP -DTOMCAT_PORT=8080 -DTOMCAT_USER=admin -DTOMCAT_PASS=TOMCAT_ADMIN_PASSWORD
    # In my case
    clean package tomcat7:redeploy -DTOMCAT_HOST=10.42.18.196 -DTOMCAT_PORT=8080 -DTOMCAT_USER=admin -DTOMCAT_PASS=2VPRIHq3Lcq4
+
image::jenkins-job-config.png[]
+
. Save the job

Now you can click _Build Now_ to run the job. If you check the _Console Output_
you will see at the end a _Build success_:

image::maven-build-result.png[]


Testing the sample app
----------------------

Now browse to http://TOMCAT_CONTAINER_IP:8080/sample/ (in my case
http://10.42.18.196:8080/sample/) and you will see some information about
the Tomcat container and your browser.

Deploying the app from your local machine
-----------------------------------------

Of course you can also deploy the app from your local computer to iterate
faster by running the maven command locally:

[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/marcaurele/sample-spring-boot.git
cd sample-spring-boot
# Replace TOMCAT_CONTAINER_IP and TOMCAT_ADMIN_PASSWORD
mvn clean package tomcat7:redeploy -DTOMCAT_HOST=TOMCAT_CONTAINER_IP -DTOMCAT_PORT=8080 -DTOMCAT_USER=admin -DTOMCAT_PASS=TOMCAT_ADMIN_PASSWORD

# In my case
mvn clean package tomcat7:redeploy -DTOMCAT_HOST=10.42.18.196 -DTOMCAT_PORT=8080 -DTOMCAT_USER=admin -DTOMCAT_PASS=2VPRIHq3Lcq4
----

Conslusion
----------

We have now a development environment running on a public cloud provider,
exoscale, with an encrypted connection to stay safe while coding our app,
without to have to think anymore about exposing or mapping ports or editing
firewall rules. This setup enables you to work from any location
(office, home, wifi hotspot) too, or to give access to your environment to
other people.
